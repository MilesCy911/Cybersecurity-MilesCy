# Cybersecurity-MilesCy
Foundational projects in command-line operations, log analysis, OSINT techniques, and threat investigation using Windows-based tools
This repository documents my hands-on learning in cybersecurity through practical, entry-level projects. The focus is on building core skills using familiar tools like Command Prompt and PowerShell, with a gradual progression toward more advanced concepts and environments.

📁 Project Structure

🔹 Windows Command Line Basics

Explore essential command-line operations for system monitoring, user activity checks, and basic network diagnostics using CMD and PowerShell.

🔹 Log Analysis

Use PowerShell to extract and analyze Windows Event Logs for suspicious activity. Learn to identify failed login attempts, privilege use, and other security-relevant events.

🔹 OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

Practice basic threat investigation techniques such as domain lookups, phishing analysis, and external intel gathering using freely available web tools.

🔹 Basic Networking Tasks

Understand how to use tools like ipconfig, netstat, tracert, and others for basic network visibility and diagnostics.

🔹 Fraud to Cybersecurity Transition

A high-level overview of how analytical skills from fraud prevention translate into cybersecurity concepts like threat hunting, anomaly detection, and behavioral analysis.

⚙️ Tools Used

Command Prompt (CMD)

PowerShell

Windows Event Viewer

OSINT Web Tools (e.g., WHOIS, VirusTotal, urlscan.io)

Markdown for documentation

📌 Goals

Reinforce security fundamentals through hands-on practice.

Build a public, trackable portfolio showcasing learning progress.

Prepare for more advanced labs using Linux, virtual machines, and real-world frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK).
