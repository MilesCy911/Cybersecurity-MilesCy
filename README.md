# üõ°Ô∏è PowerShell Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my PowerShell cybersecurity portfolio ‚Äî a collection of practical tasks that simulate how defenders use PowerShell to investigate, audit, and monitor Windows systems.

Each task demonstrates a key technique useful for system forensics, threat hunting, and real-time response.
